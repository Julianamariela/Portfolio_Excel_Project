#  Sales Data Analysis and Reporting

## Overview
Superstores is an American-based retailer specializing in electronic appliances and accessories, with a diverse range of products, including phones, laptops, and related items. The company operates in 10 cities and 8 regions.

This project aims to analyse the sales data for Superstores by merging and preparing 12 months of sales stored in different CSV files. The analysis includes revenue and profit calculations, creating forecasts, and visualizing the results in an interactive report using Excel's powerful features.

## Project Structure
The project can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Data Merging and Preparation:
   The 12 CSV files containing sales data are merged into a single dataset using Excel's Power Query feature. This consolidated data is then cleaned and transformed to make it suitable for analysis.

2. Calculating Revenue and Profit:
   Power Pivot is utilized to create measures for calculating revenue and profit based on the cleaned sales data. This step helps in gaining valuable insights into the company's financial performance.

3. Data Analysis and Forecasting:
   The prepared data is used to generate pivot tables and charts, enabling the exploration of various aspects of the sales data. Forecasting is conducted by creating a forecast worksheet to predict future trends.

4. Dashboard Creation:
   An interative Excel dashboard is designed to present the key findings and insights from the analysis visually. The dashboard comprises charts and graphics, providing an intuitive representation of the sales performance.

5. Interactive Report in PowerPoint:
   The final analysis results are used to create an interactive report in PowerPoint. The report includes visuals, charts, and summaries, making it easier to present and share the analysis with stakeholders.
